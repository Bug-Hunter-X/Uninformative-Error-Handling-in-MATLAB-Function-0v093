This repository demonstrates an example of uninformative error handling in a MATLAB function. The function `myFunction` takes an input and performs some computation. If the input is negative, it throws an error. However, the error message is quite generic and doesn't provide much information about the source of the problem. This could make debugging more difficult. The solution provides more informative error message using `MException`.
